# Wait what? Where did the Mirror 2018 branch of Ignorance go?
The 2018 branch of Ignorance is no more. As of a recent commit done by the upstream Mirror developers, the master branch of Ignorance is now compatible with both Mirror master and 2018 branches.

## Is Ignorance dead?
No, but unification of the transport systems between Mirror master and 2018 versions were very much long overdue in my personal opinion.

### But but I really want to go back in time!
You can go back in time by cloning this git and then going back to a specific commit before this one.

***See you on the master branch!***
